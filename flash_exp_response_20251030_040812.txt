This response provides a textual description of the patent drawing.  Generating a true patent drawing requires specialized software and expertise.  This description is detailed enough to guide a professional patent illustrator.

**Figure 1: Smart Blockchain Hardware Wallet**

**Sheet:** 1 of 1

**Description:** This figure depicts a cross-sectional view of the Smart Blockchain Hardware Wallet, showcasing its internal components and external features.

**Drawing:**

*   **Overall Appearance:** The drawing is a cross-sectional view, preferably along the longest axis of the elliptical enclosure.  Use clean, crisp black lines on a white background.  Line weights should vary to indicate depth and importance.  Hatching should be used sparingly to indicate solid materials.  All components should be clearly labeled with numbers and corresponding descriptions.

*   **1. Elliptical Enclosure:**  Show the outer casing as an ellipse, slightly flattened on the bottom for stability.  The cross-section should reveal the internal cavity.  Use a thicker line weight for the outer boundary.  Indicate the material (e.g., "Aluminum Alloy" or "High-Impact Plastic") in the specification.

*   **2. Biometric Fingerprint Scanner:**  Position the fingerprint scanner on the top surface of the enclosure, near one end.  Show it as a small, rectangular component integrated into the enclosure.  Use a slightly recessed area to indicate its presence.  Include fine lines to suggest the sensor surface.

*   **3. OLED Display Screen:**  Place the OLED display screen on the top surface of the enclosure, adjacent to the fingerprint scanner.  Show it as a rectangular component, slightly larger than the fingerprint scanner.  Use a thin line to represent the screen surface.  Consider adding a very faint dotted line within the rectangle to suggest the display area.

*   **4. PCB Main Board:**  Show the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) as a rectangular board occupying a significant portion of the internal cavity.  It should be positioned centrally within the enclosure.  Use a medium line weight.  Indicate the presence of various surface-mounted components with small, simplified rectangles and squares.  Do not attempt to draw individual components in detail.

*   **5. Lithium Battery:**  Position the lithium battery below the PCB, taking up a substantial portion of the remaining space.  Show it as a rectangular block with rounded corners.  Use a medium line weight.  Add a small "+" and "-" symbol to indicate polarity.

*   **6. Wireless Charging Coil:**  Place the wireless charging coil on the bottom surface of the enclosure, directly below the lithium battery.  Show it as a series of concentric circles or a spiral pattern.  Use a thin line weight.

*   **7. USB-C Interface:**  Position the USB-C interface on one end of the enclosure.  Show it as a small, rectangular port with the characteristic USB-C shape.  Use a thin line weight.  Indicate the internal connection to the PCB with a dashed line.

*   **8. Physical Buttons:**  Place two or three small, circular physical buttons on the side of the enclosure.  Show them as small circles with a slightly raised profile.  Use a thin line weight.  Indicate the internal connection to the PCB with dashed lines.

*   **9. Modular Security Chip:**  Show the modular security chip as a small, rectangular component mounted on the PCB.  Use a slightly thicker line weight than other PCB components to emphasize its importance.  Label it clearly.

*   **10. Anti-tamper Structure:**  This is the most abstract element.  Represent the anti-tamper structure as a network of fine lines or a mesh-like pattern surrounding the PCB and/or the security chip.  This could also be represented as a tamper-evident seal around the enclosure.  The key is to visually suggest a protective layer or mechanism.  Use a very thin line weight.  Consider showing a small break in the enclosure to illustrate the anti-tamper mechanism.

**Numbering and Labels:**

Clearly label each component with a number and a leader line pointing to the corresponding feature in the drawing.  The labels should be placed outside the enclosure to avoid clutter.

2.  Biometric Fingerprint Scanner
3.  OLED Display Screen
4.  PCB Main Board
5.  Lithium Battery
6.  Wireless Charging Coil
7.  USB-C Interface
8.  Physical Buttons
9.  Modular Security Chip
10. Anti-tamper Structure

**Important Considerations for a Patent Illustrator:**

*   **Clarity:** The drawing should be clear and easy to understand.
*   **Accuracy:** The components should be represented accurately and proportionally.
*   **Consistency:** Use consistent line weights and styles throughout the drawing.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure the drawing complies with all applicable patent office regulations.
*   **Cross-Sectional View:** Make sure the cross-section is clearly indicated with hatching or other appropriate techniques.
*   **Scale:** The drawing should be to scale, or at least proportionally accurate.  Indicate the scale if possible.

This detailed description should allow a professional patent illustrator to create a high-quality technical drawing suitable for a patent application. Remember to consult with a patent attorney or agent to ensure that the drawing meets all legal requirements.
